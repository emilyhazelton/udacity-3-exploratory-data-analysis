# Project Summary

For my third Udacity project, I analyzed loan data from Prosper. The Prosper data was collected between 2005 and 2014 and includes 114,000 rows. 

Project Tasks: 

* Create code for processing data in an RMD file; code utilizes good coding practices, works, and is commented in a helpful way.
* Use markdown to improve presentation.
* Use univariate, bivariate, and multivariate plots to explore relationships in the data set (create at least 20 visualizations). 
* Include questions and observations throughout the analysis.
* Conclude with a final summary section that includes three plots and commentary; plots and commentary should be able to stand alone and include axis and title labels.
